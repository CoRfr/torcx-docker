Docker binaries for torcx
=========================

This provides some pre-built Docker torcx images that can be used with
[CoreOS Container Linux](https://coreos.com/).

Images are extracted from official Container Linux builds, and provided as this repository.
That way they can be fetched directly from GitHub and included into an initrd.
